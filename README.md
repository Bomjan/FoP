## Overview

Welcome to my academic portfolio for the **Fundamentals of Programming** course. This repository documents my journey through learning various programming paradigms, languages, and problem-solving techniques.

It serves as a central hub for all my:
- **Classworks**: Daily exercises and concept explorations.
- **Assignments**: Graded tasks and larger implementations.
- **Projects**: Major applications demonstrating integrated skills.
- **Exams**: Solutions to practical tests and assessments.
